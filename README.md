# DiegWork
This is a neural network built from scratch in order to learn more about them

Currently what needs to be done is learning about the Layers and implementing them

O for done, X for not done

Input layer, where the inputs go, not necessarily a layer, more just a way to understand inputs:
  Sometimes this can be the considered the 0th layer

  
Middle layers, where the math is:
  When counting layers we start here

  
output layer, where the final sum is tallied and you get the output:

notations of layers:
  n= layer
  n^[x] is the xth layer
  n^[x] = y is the amount of nodes(y) in the xth layer
  n^[L] = the total lumber of layers
